    <p>The applications for artificial intelligence are too many. Artificial intelligence is used in the healthcare industry for dosing drugs and for surgical procedures. In games like chess and self-driving cars, machines must weigh the consequences of any action they take because each action will affect on the result. Like chess the final result is victory.</p>
    <p>Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.</p>
    
    <p>There is a difference between machine learning and deep learning:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Machine learning: it feeds a computer data and focuses on the development of computer programs</li>
    <li>Deep learning: is a type of machine learning .it runs input by Biologically inspired neural network structure that includes a number of hidden layers that process data to collect the best results.</li>
